***LiveCam Face Recognition with Multi person matching and Threshold alert***
1.We want a upload button , where we can upload a photo through files.
2.When we upload a certain photo , we should compare the uploaded photo with face cam video.
3.The uploaded photo is then compared with the faces that are detected in the cam.
4.Show the similarity match percentage , between the uploaded image and multi faces in the cam.
5.If the match percentage is below 20 , then the words "Not the person " should appear under the box.
  If the match percentage is between 50-70 , then "Possibility chances".
  If the match percentage is 80-90, then "certainly could be the person".
  If the match is above 90 , then "FOUND THE PERSON".
6.Give an alert when the match above 90 is found.
7.Show the captured face of 90% match with "ALERT!!" as the output

UPDATE: 17-12-25
Updating requirements that are yet to be added to the project

1. ALERT BEEP SOUND AFTER THE PICTURE SIMILARITY IS ABOVE 85 .
2. MULTIPLE FACE DETECTION IS NOT WORKING , ONLY ONE PERSON FACE IS BEING DETECTED BUT NOT MULTIPLE FACES.
3. AFTER THE FACE IS FOUND , ALERT SOUND BEEP SHOULD RING AND THE CAPTURED FACE SHOULD BE SENT TO WHATSAPP OR MAIL AS A NOTIFICATION.
4. THE PERSON'S CAPTURED FACE FROM LIVE CAM WILL GO TO CERTAIN NUMBER OR MAIL .
5. THE IP ADDRESS OF THE DEVICE THAT SENT THE CAPTURED PHOTO SHOULD BE APPEARING AS WELL , IT SHOULD BE SENT IN MAIL OR WHATSAPP
